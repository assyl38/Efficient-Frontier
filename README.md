# Efficient-Frontier

## What is an Efficient Frontier?
An efficient frontier is a set of investment portfolios that are expected to provide the highest returns at a given level of risk. A portfolio is said to be efficient if there is no other portfolio that offers higher returns for a lower or equal amount of risk. Where portfolios are located on the efficient frontier depends on the investor’s degree of risk tolerance.
The efficient frontier is a curved line. It is because every increase in risk results in a relatively smaller amount of returns. In other words, there is a diminishing marginal return to risk, and it results in a curvature.

Diversifying the assets in your portfolio leads to increased returns and decreased risks, which leads to a portfolio that is located on the efficient frontier. Therefore, diversification can create an efficient portfolio that is located on a curved line.

## How Does an Efficient Frontier Work?
It is represented by plotting the expected returns of a portfolio and the standard deviation of returns. The y-axis is made up of the expected returns of the portfolio. The x-axis is labeled as the standard deviation of returns, which is a measure of risk.

A portfolio is then plotted onto the graph according to its expected returns and standard deviation of returns. The portfolio is compared to the efficient frontier. If a portfolio is plotted on the right side of the chart, it indicates that there is a higher level of risk for the given portfolio. If it is plotted low on the graph, the portfolio offers low returns.

In our example, there are two assets. The first asset’s expected return is 15%, and the other shows an expected return of 7%. The standard deviation of the first asset is 18%, whereas the second asset shows a standard deviation of 10%. The table below shows the standard deviation and expected returns for a portfolio that consists of both assets. When data points in the table are plotted, it shows an efficient frontier.
